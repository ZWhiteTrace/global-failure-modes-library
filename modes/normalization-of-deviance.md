# Normalization of Deviance

Repeated rule violations become accepted practice when they don't immediately cause failure.

## Warning Signs

- [ ] "Everyone does it this way"
- [ ] Workarounds documented as standard procedure
- [ ] Safety steps skipped because "nothing bad happened before"
- [ ] New hires told to ignore official documentation

## Real-World Examples

**NASA Columbia**: Foam strikes normalized because previous flights survived.

**Healthcare**: Hand hygiene compliance declining without immediate consequences.

**Software**: Deploying without tests "just this once" becoming standard.

## Mitigation Checklist

1. **Near-Miss Tracking**: Treat close calls as seriously as failures
2. **Procedure Audits**: Regular checks of actual vs documented practice
3. **Speak-Up Culture**: Reward reporting deviations, not hiding them
4. **Consequence Awareness**: Regular reminders of why rules exist
5. **Fresh Perspective**: External audits by those without institutional blindness

## Culture Questions

- Are there unwritten rules that contradict official policy?
- What would a new hire find surprising about our actual practices?
- When did we last have a near-miss that we brushed off?
